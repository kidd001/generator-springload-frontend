# generator-springload-frontend

Kick off the front-end of your next project.

You'll need grunt installed, and yo.

You may need to sudo the install task, depending on your environment.

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-springload-frontend
```

Once everything's installed, you call the generator with
```
yo springload-frontend
```

Finally, wire everything up with grunt
```
grunt install
```

There's a sweet, auto-reloading grunt stack set up in there too. 

Call it with `grunt watch`.


That's all folks!


### Updating 

When we push a new version of the generator, just call install again:
```
npm install -g generator-springload-frontend
```
